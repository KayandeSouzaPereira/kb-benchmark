# Mutation audit log

**Every mutation of a user, invitation or role writes an `AuditEntry`** to
`store.auditLog`, in the same operation (never "later, async").

## Mandatory format

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `id` | new UUID |
| `tenantId` | tenant where it happened |
| `actorId` | who performed it (header `X-Actor-Id`) |
| `action` | one of the actions below |
| `targetId` | id of the affected resource (user or invitation) |
| `timestamp` | `Instant.now()` (UTC) |
| `details` | optional, free text |

## Valid actions

- `USER_INVITED` — invitation created (`targetId` = invitation id)
- `INVITATION_RESENT` — invitation resent (`targetId` = invitation id)
- `USER_ROLE_CHANGED` — role changed (`targetId` = user id)
- `USER_SOFT_DELETED` — user deleted (`targetId` = user id)
- `USER_RESTORED` — user restored within the retention window

## Anti-patterns already observed

- Audit only **effective** mutations. Denied attempts (403/422) do NOT produce
  an audit entry.
- Inventing action strings outside the enum above (breaks compliance
  dashboards).
